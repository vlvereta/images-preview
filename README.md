# Requirements

We would like you to build a React web application that allows users to search and browse images online (similar to Flickr, Google Images, and Pixabay). As a user, I should be able to type in a search keyword such as “dogs” and see a list of dog pictures in the app. The user interface (UI) does not need to be complex, but should contain components to support the basic functionalities (i.e. search input bar, image blocks).

The application must be built using React (not jQuery) and contain some custom styling using CSS. You are also welcome to bring in other tools and libraries as needed, such as TypeScript, Material-UI, Bootstrap, a third party HTTP client, etc.

For your convenience, we’ve set up an API credential from Pixabay that you can use. However, you don’t have to use this if you prefer another API from a different provider.
